# jmodel-mapper
An extensible model mapping framework, compose of an eclipse plugin (provide a simple model mapping DSL)  and a general model mapping core. 

# What is it?
Mapping between models in different formats always is boring. You have to face various technologies, languages, and frameworks. Why don't you imagine such a scene? I know the structures of source model and target model, then point out the mapping relation between fields, then again, say I want to convert the model from JSON to XML, it's done. JSON? XML? Should I care them? No. OK, jmodel-mapper can do this for you. This is what jmodel-mapper is.

# Why use it?
How long will it take to finish a mapping job? One day or one week? If you are not very familiar with JSON or XML, or other specified model format? jmodel-mapper could save your days and hours, because you don't need to learn more technologies, actually...
